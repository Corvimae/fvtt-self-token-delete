# Self Token Delete for Foundry VTT

Plugin for Foundry VTT that allows users to delete tokens they own. Select a token and hit Backspace to remove it from the scene.

A GM must be in game for the token to get deleted.

**This module is inherently insecure, and opens an exploit that can allow malicious users to delete tokens they do not own. Do not use
this module with players you do not trust.**
